## This recipe describes the processing of the reads_ranking.txt table to obtain the True Negatives, True Positives, False Negatives and False Positives rates at each taxonomic level in order to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and Matthews correlation coefficient for every combination of taxonomic annotation tool and database. The following steps are the same for both, 16SrRNA amplicon and Whole Metagenome Shotgun data. The first step is to obtain the relation between each taxonomic annotation and the taxonomic level reached:

$ taxid2level.py reads_ranking.txt

## The output is a level_taxid.out table (see an example in the correspondig examples directory), that contains the read id, the taxonomic level reached in the annotation and the taxid of such annotation. Then, we used this table plus the tabla_sort2.tab and the number of shuffled sequences include in the dataset to calculate the True Negatives, True Positives, False Negatives and False Positives, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient at each taxonomic level using the error_types_v4.pl script:

$ error_types_v4.pl level_taxid.out tabla_sort2.tab 846578

## This step generates the error_description.txt file. At this moment, we had a types_error.out file for each dataset. Finally, the respective triplicates were concatenated, see an example in example_error_description.txt file in the examples directory of this repository.
