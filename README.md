# Metagenomic-benchmark
The code deposited in this site contains the necessary scripts to integrate, standardise and generate taxonomic annotation matrices at the eight basic levels of taxonomic lineage: domain, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species and subspecies. These tools provide the possibility of comparing taxonomic annotation results obtained by different methods and databases.
